# PyBer_Analysis

## Objective
In this challenge, Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, required assistance in analyzing information from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. The challenge involves preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. 

## Purpose
1. Collect the student data into a DataFrame.
2. Prepare a cleaned version of the DataFrame.
3. Summarize key pieces of the data.
4. Drill down into the data to analyze specific subsets.
5. Compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions.
6. A written analysis of the results. 

## Summary
1. Deliverable 1 helped in understanding the importance of creating a right path to read a csv file and further using the 'head' function to ensure the file has been imported properly.
2. Deliverable 2 involved preparing the data by checking the null and duplicated values in the data. Further, dropping them using 'dropna' and 'drop_duplicates' function respectively. It also helped in understanding the data types and changing them, if required.
3. Deliverable 3 was concerned about summarizing the data using 'describe' function and an insight into the working of 'mean' function.
4. Deliverable 4 was about using the 'loc' and 'iloc' function to get specific data from the data frame such as grades, scores. Using conditionals along, to combine and get desirable outcomes out of the data frame.
5. Deliverable 5 assisted in knowing the way to do comparisons within the data by using 'groupby' function and applying it with functions such as 'mean','count' functions to the different categories of data.
6. In addition to the above analysis, we can also remove null values from the data using a 'subset', which will only remove data from that selected column.
7. In step 4, we can also find the maximum scores of reading or math by using the 'max' function.
